+ For consistency, renamed Math.php to Maths.java, utils to util,
  tests to test, docs to doc -

+ Removed conditional logic from top of Matrix class.

+ Switched to using hypo function in Maths.php for all php-hypot calls.
  NOTE TO SELF: Need to make sure that all decompositions have been
  switched over to using the bundled hypo.

+ Recommend using simpler Error.php instead of JAMA_Error.php but
  can be persuaded otherwise.
