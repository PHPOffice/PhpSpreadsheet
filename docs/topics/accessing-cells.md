# Accessing cells

Accessing cells in a Spreadsheet should be pretty straightforward. This
topic lists some of the options to access a cell.

## Setting a cell value by coordinate

Setting a cell value by coordinate can be done using the worksheet's
`setCellValue()` method.

``` php
// Set cell A1 with a string value
$spreadsheet->getActiveSheet()->setCellValue('A1', 'PhpSpreadsheet');

// Set cell A2 with a numeric value
$spreadsheet->getActiveSheet()->setCellValue('A2', 12345.6789);

// Set cell A3 with a boolean value
$spreadsheet->getActiveSheet()->setCellValue('A3', TRUE);

// Set cell A4 with a formula
$spreadsheet->getActiveSheet()->setCellValue(
    'A4',
    '=IF(A3, CONCATENATE(A1, " ", A2), CONCATENATE(A2, " ", A1))'
);
```

Alternatively, you can retrieve the cell object, and then call the
cell’s `setValue()` method:

``` php
$spreadsheet->getActiveSheet()
    ->getCell('B8')
    ->setValue('Some value');
```

## Excel DataTypes

MS Excel supports 7 basic datatypes:

- string
- number
- boolean
- null
- formula
- error
- Inline (or rich text) string

By default, when you call the worksheet's `setCellValue()` method or the
cell's `setValue()` method, PhpSpreadsheet will use the appropriate
datatype for PHP nulls, booleans, floats or integers; or cast any string
data value that you pass to the method into the most appropriate
datatype, so numeric strings will be cast to numbers, while string
values beginning with `=` will be converted to a formula. Strings that
aren't numeric, or that don't begin with a leading `=` will be treated
as genuine string values.

This "conversion" is handled by a cell "value binder", and you can write
custom "value binders" to change the behaviour of these "conversions".
The standard PhpSpreadsheet package also provides an "advanced value
binder" that handles a number of more complex conversions, such as
converting strings with a fractional format like "3/4" to a number value
(0.75 in this case) and setting an appropriate "fraction" number format
mask. Similarly, strings like "5%" will be converted to a value of 0.05,
and a percentage number format mask applied, and strings containing
values that look like dates will be converted to Excel serialized
datetimestamp values, and a corresponding mask applied. This is
particularly useful when loading data from csv files, or setting cell
values from a database.

Formats handled by the advanced value binder include:

- TRUE or FALSE (dependent on locale settings) are converted to booleans.
- Numeric strings identified as scientific (exponential) format are
  converted to numbers.
- Fractions and vulgar fractions are converted to numbers, and
  an appropriate number format mask applied.
- Percentages are converted
  to numbers, divided by 100, and an appropriate number format mask
  applied.
- Dates and times are converted to Excel timestamp values
  (numbers), and an appropriate number format mask applied.
- When strings contain a newline character (`\n`), then the cell styling is
  set to wrap.

You can read more about value binders later in this section of the
documentation.

### Setting a date and/or time value in a cell

Date or time values are held as timestamp in Excel (a simple floating
point value), and a number format mask is used to show how that value
should be formatted; so if we want to store a date in a cell, we need to
calculate the correct Excel timestamp, and set a number format mask.

``` php
// Get the current date/time and convert to an Excel date/time
$dateTimeNow = time();
$excelDateValue = \PhpOffice\PhpSpreadsheet\Shared\Date::PHPToExcel( $dateTimeNow );
// Set cell A6 with the Excel date/time value
$spreadsheet->getActiveSheet()->setCellValue(
    'A6',
    $excelDateValue
);
// Set the number format mask so that the excel timestamp will be displayed as a human-readable date/time
$spreadsheet->getActiveSheet()->getStyle('A6')
    ->getNumberFormat()
    ->setFormatCode(
        \PhpOffice\PhpSpreadsheet\Style\NumberFormat::FORMAT_DATE_DATETIME
    );
```

### Setting a number with leading zeroes

By default, PhpSpreadsheet will automatically detect the value type and
set it to the appropriate Excel numeric datatype. This type conversion
is handled by a value binder, as described in the section of this
document entitled "Using value binders to facilitate data entry".

Numbers don't have leading zeroes, so if you try to set a numeric value
that does have leading zeroes (such as a telephone number) then these
will be normally be lost as the value is cast to a number, so
"01513789642" will be displayed as 1513789642.

There are two ways you can force PhpSpreadsheet to override this
behaviour.

Firstly, you can set the datatype explicitly as a string so that it is
not converted to a number.

``` php
// Set cell A8 with a numeric value, but tell PhpSpreadsheet it should be treated as a string
$spreadsheet->getActiveSheet()->setCellValueExplicit(
    'A8',
    "01513789642",
    \PhpOffice\PhpSpreadsheet\Cell\DataType::TYPE_STRING
);
```

Alternatively, you can use a number format mask to display the value
with leading zeroes.

``` php
// Set cell A9 with a numeric value
$spreadsheet->getActiveSheet()->setCellValue('A9', 1513789642);
// Set a number format mask to display the value as 11 digits with leading zeroes
$spreadsheet->getActiveSheet()->getStyle('A9')
    ->getNumberFormat()
    ->setFormatCode(
        '00000000000'
    );
```

With number format masking, you can even break up the digits into groups
to make the value more easily readable.

``` php
// Set cell A10 with a numeric value
$spreadsheet->getActiveSheet()->setCellValue('A10', 1513789642);
// Set a number format mask to display the value as 11 digits with leading zeroes
$spreadsheet->getActiveSheet()->getStyle('A10')
    ->getNumberFormat()
    ->setFormatCode(
        '0000-000-0000'
    );
```

**Note** that not all complex format masks such as this one will work
when retrieving a formatted value to display "on screen", or for certain
writers such as HTML or PDF, but it will work with the true spreadsheet
writers (Xlsx and Xls).

## Setting a range of cells from an array

It is also possible to set a range of cell values in a single call by
passing an array of values to the `fromArray()` method.

``` php
$arrayData = array(
    array(NULL, 2010, 2011, 2012),
    array('Q1',   12,   15,   21),
    array('Q2',   56,   73,   86),
    array('Q3',   52,   61,   69),
    array('Q4',   30,   32,    0),
);
$spreadsheet->getActiveSheet()
    ->fromArray(
        $arrayData,  // The data to set
        NULL,        // Array values with this value will not be set
        'C3'         // Top left coordinate of the worksheet range where
                     //    we want to set these values (default is A1)
    );
```

![07-simple-example-2.png](./images/07-simple-example-2.png)

If you pass a 2-d array, then this will be treated as a series of rows
and columns. A 1-d array will be treated as a single row, which is
particularly useful if you're fetching an array of data from a database.

``` php
$rowArray = array('Value1', 'Value2', 'Value3', 'Value4');
$spreadsheet->getActiveSheet()
    ->fromArray(
        $rowArray,   // The data to set
        NULL,        // Array values with this value will not be set
        'C3'         // Top left coordinate of the worksheet range where
                     //    we want to set these values (default is A1)
    );
```

![07-simple-example-3.png](./images/07-simple-example-3.png)

If you have a simple 1-d array, and want to write it as a column, then
the following will convert it into an appropriately structured 2-d array
that can be fed to the `fromArray()` method:

``` php
$rowArray = array('Value1', 'Value2', 'Value3', 'Value4');
$columnArray = array_chunk($rowArray, 1);
$spreadsheet->getActiveSheet()
    ->fromArray(
        $columnArray,   // The data to set
        NULL,           // Array values with this value will not be set
        'C3'            // Top left coordinate of the worksheet range where
                        //    we want to set these values (default is A1)
    );
```

![07-simple-example-4.png](./images/07-simple-example-4.png)

## Retrieving a cell value by coordinate

To retrieve the value of a cell, the cell should first be retrieved from
the worksheet using the `getCell()` method. A cell's value can be read
using the `getValue()` method.

``` php
// Get the value fom cell A1
$cellValue = $spreadsheet->getActiveSheet()->getCell('A1')
    ->getValue();
```

This will retrieve the raw, unformatted value contained in the cell.

If a cell contains a formula, and you need to retrieve the calculated
value rather than the formula itself, then use the cell's
`getCalculatedValue()` method. This is further explained in .

``` php
// Get the value fom cell A4
$cellValue = $spreadsheet->getActiveSheet()->getCell('A4')
    ->getCalculatedValue();
```

Alternatively, if you want to see the value with any cell formatting
applied (e.g. for a human-readable date or time value), then you can use
the cell's `getFormattedValue()` method.

``` php
// Get the value fom cell A6
$cellValue = $spreadsheet->getActiveSheet()->getCell('A6')
    ->getFormattedValue();
```

## Setting a cell value by column and row

Setting a cell value by coordinate can be done using the worksheet's
`setCellValueByColumnAndRow()` method.

``` php
// Set cell B5 with a string value
$spreadsheet->getActiveSheet()->setCellValueByColumnAndRow(1, 5, 'PhpSpreadsheet');
```

**Note** that column references start with `0` for column `A`, rather
than from `1`.

## Retrieving a cell value by column and row

To retrieve the value of a cell, the cell should first be retrieved from
the worksheet using the getCellByColumnAndRow method. A cell’s value can
be read again using the following line of code:

``` php
// Get the value fom cell B5
$cellValue = $spreadsheet->getActiveSheet()->getCellByColumnAndRow(1, 5)
    ->getValue();
```

If you need the calculated value of a cell, use the following code. This
is further explained in .

``` php
// Get the value fom cell A4
$cellValue = $spreadsheet->getActiveSheet()->getCellByColumnAndRow(0, 4)
    ->getCalculatedValue();
```

## Retrieving a range of cell values to an array

It is also possible to retrieve a range of cell values to an array in a
single call using the `toArray()`, `rangeToArray()` or
`namedRangeToArray()` methods.

``` php
$dataArray = $spreadsheet->getActiveSheet()
    ->rangeToArray(
        'C3:E5',     // The worksheet range that we want to retrieve
        NULL,        // Value that should be returned for empty cells
        TRUE,        // Should formulas be calculated (the equivalent of getCalculatedValue() for each cell)
        TRUE,        // Should values be formatted (the equivalent of getFormattedValue() for each cell)
        TRUE         // Should the array be indexed by cell row and cell column
    );
```

These methods will all return a 2-d array of rows and columns. The
`toArray()` method will return the whole worksheet; `rangeToArray()`
will return a specified range or cells; while `namedRangeToArray()` will
return the cells within a defined `named range`.

## Looping through cells

### Looping through cells using iterators

The easiest way to loop cells is by using iterators. Using iterators,
one can use foreach to loop worksheets, rows within a worksheet, and
cells within a row.

Below is an example where we read all the values in a worksheet and
display them in a table.

``` php
$reader = \PhpOffice\PhpSpreadsheet\IOFactory::createReader('Xlsx');
$reader->setReadDataOnly(TRUE);
$spreadsheet = $reader->load("test.xlsx");

$worksheet = $spreadsheet->getActiveSheet();

echo '<table>' . PHP_EOL;
foreach ($worksheet->getRowIterator() as $row) {
    echo '<tr>' . PHP_EOL;
    $cellIterator = $row->getCellIterator();
    $cellIterator->setIterateOnlyExistingCells(FALSE); // This loops through all cells,
                                                       //    even if a cell value is not set.
                                                       // By default, only cells that have a value
                                                       //    set will be iterated.
    foreach ($cellIterator as $cell) {
        echo '<td>' .
             $cell->getValue() .
             '</td>' . PHP_EOL;
    }
    echo '</tr>' . PHP_EOL;
}
echo '</table>' . PHP_EOL;
```

Note that we have set the cell iterator's
`setIterateOnlyExistingCells()` to FALSE. This makes the iterator loop
all cells within the worksheet range, even if they have not been set.

The cell iterator will return a **NULL** as the cell value if it is not
set in the worksheet. Setting the cell iterator's
setIterateOnlyExistingCells() to FALSE will loop all cells in the
worksheet that can be available at that moment. This will create new
cells if required and increase memory usage! Only use it if it is
intended to loop all cells that are possibly available.

### Looping through cells using indexes

One can use the possibility to access cell values by column and row
index like (0,1) instead of 'A1' for reading and writing cell values in
loops.

Note: In PhpSpreadsheet column index is 0-based while row index is
1-based. That means 'A1' \~ (0,1)

Below is an example where we read all the values in a worksheet and
display them in a table.

``` php
$reader = \PhpOffice\PhpSpreadsheet\IOFactory::createReader('Xlsx');
$reader->setReadDataOnly(TRUE);
$spreadsheet = $reader->load("test.xlsx");

$worksheet = $spreadsheet->getActiveSheet();
// Get the highest row and column numbers referenced in the worksheet
$highestRow = $worksheet->getHighestRow(); // e.g. 10
$highestColumn = $worksheet->getHighestColumn(); // e.g 'F'
$highestColumnIndex = \PhpOffice\PhpSpreadsheet\Cell::columnIndexFromString($highestColumn); // e.g. 5

echo '<table>' . "\n";
for ($row = 1; $row <= $highestRow; ++$row) {
    echo '<tr>' . PHP_EOL;
    for ($col = 0; $col <= $highestColumnIndex; ++$col) {
        echo '<td>' .
             $worksheet->getCellByColumnAndRow($col, $row)
                 ->getValue() .
             '</td>' . PHP_EOL;
    }
    echo '</tr>' . PHP_EOL;
}
echo '</table>' . PHP_EOL;
```

Alternatively, you can take advantage of PHP's "Perl-style" character
incrementors to loop through the cells by coordinate:

``` php
$reader = \PhpOffice\PhpSpreadsheet\IOFactory::createReader('Xlsx');
$reader->setReadDataOnly(TRUE);
$spreadsheet = $reader->load("test.xlsx");

$worksheet = $spreadsheet->getActiveSheet();
// Get the highest row number and column letter referenced in the worksheet
$highestRow = $worksheet->getHighestRow(); // e.g. 10
$highestColumn = $worksheet->getHighestColumn(); // e.g 'F'
// Increment the highest column letter
$highestColumn++;

echo '<table>' . "\n";
for ($row = 1; $row <= $highestRow; ++$row) {
    echo '<tr>' . PHP_EOL;
    for ($col = 'A'; $col != $highestColumn; ++$col) {
        echo '<td>' .
             $worksheet->getCell($col . $row)
                 ->getValue() .
             '</td>' . PHP_EOL;
    }
    echo '</tr>' . PHP_EOL;
}
echo '</table>' . PHP_EOL;
```

Note that we can't use a &lt;= comparison here, because 'AA' would match
as &lt;= 'B', so we increment the highest column letter and then loop
while \$col != the incremented highest column.

## Using value binders to facilitate data entry

Internally, PhpSpreadsheet uses a default
\PhpOffice\PhpSpreadsheet\Cell\IValueBinder implementation
(\PhpOffice\PhpSpreadsheet\Cell\DefaultValueBinder) to determine data
types of entered data using a cell's `setValue()` method (the
`setValueExplicit()` method bypasses this check).

Optionally, the default behaviour of PhpSpreadsheet can be modified,
allowing easier data entry. For example, a
\PhpOffice\PhpSpreadsheet\Cell\AdvancedValueBinder class is available.
It automatically converts percentages, number in scientific format, and
dates entered as strings to the correct format, also setting the cell's
style information. The following example demonstrates how to set the
value binder in PhpSpreadsheet:

``` php
/** PhpSpreadsheet */
require_once 'src/Boostrap.php';

// Set value binder
\PhpOffice\PhpSpreadsheet\Cell::setValueBinder( new \PhpOffice\PhpSpreadsheet\Cell\AdvancedValueBinder() );

// Create new Spreadsheet object
$spreadsheet = new \PhpOffice\PhpSpreadsheet\Spreadsheet();

// ...
// Add some data, resembling some different data types
$spreadsheet->getActiveSheet()->setCellValue('A4', 'Percentage value:');
// Converts the string value to 0.1 and sets percentage cell style
$spreadsheet->getActiveSheet()->setCellValue('B4', '10%');

$spreadsheet->getActiveSheet()->setCellValue('A5', 'Date/time value:');
// Converts the string value to an Excel datestamp and sets the date format cell style
$spreadsheet->getActiveSheet()->setCellValue('B5', '21 December 1983');
```

**Creating your own value binder is easy.** When advanced value binding
is required, you can implement the
\PhpOffice\PhpSpreadsheet\Cell\IValueBinder interface or extend the
\PhpOffice\PhpSpreadsheet\Cell\DefaultValueBinder or
\PhpOffice\PhpSpreadsheet\Cell\AdvancedValueBinder classes.
