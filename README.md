PhpSpreadsheet is a library written in pure PHP and offers a set of classes that
allow you to read and write various spreadsheet file formats such as Excel and LibreOffice Calc.

## PHP version support

LTS: Support for PHP versions will only be maintained for a period of six months beyond the
[end of life of that PHP version](https://www.php.net/eol.php).

Currently the required PHP minimum version is PHP __7.3__.

See the `composer.json` for other requirements.

## Installation

Use [composer](https://getcomposer.org) to install PhpSpreadsheet into your project:

```sh
composer require phpoffice/phpspreadsheet
```

If you are building your installation on a development machine that is on a different PHP version to the server where it will be deployed, or if your PHP CLI version is not the same as your run-time such as `php-fpm` or Apache's `mod_php`, then you might want to add the following to your `composer.json` before installing:
```json lines
{
    "require": {
        "phpoffice/phpspreadsheet": "^1.23"
    },
    "config": {
        "platform": {
            "php": "7.3"
        }
    }
}
```
and then run
```sh
composer install
```
to ensure that the correct dependencies are retrieved to match your deployment environment.

See [CLI vs Application run-time](https://php.watch/articles/composer-platform-check) for more details.

## Documentation

Read more about it, including install instructions, in the [official documentation](https://phpspreadsheet.readthedocs.io). Or check out the [API documentation](https://phpoffice.github.io/PhpSpreadsheet).

## PHPExcel vs PhpSpreadsheet ?

PhpSpreadsheet is the next version of PHPExcel. It breaks compatibility to dramatically improve the code base quality (namespaces, PSR compliance, use of latest PHP language features, etc.).

Because all efforts have shifted to PhpSpreadsheet, PHPExcel will no longer be maintained. All contributions for PHPExcel, patches and new features, should target PhpSpreadsheet `master` branch.

Do you need to migrate? There is [an automated tool](/docs/topics/migration-from-PHPExcel.md) for that.
