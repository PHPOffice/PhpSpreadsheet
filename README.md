PhpSpreadsheet is a library written in pure PHP and offers a set of classes that
allow you to read and write various spreadsheet file formats such as Excel and LibreOffice Calc.

## PHPExcel vs PhpSpreadsheet ?

PhpSpreadsheet is the next version of PHPExcel. It breaks compatibility to dramatically improve the code base quality (namespaces, PSR compliance, use of latest PHP language features, etc.).

Because all efforts have shifted to PhpSpreadsheet, PHPExcel will no longer be maintained. All contributions for PHPExcel, patches and new features, should target PhpSpreadsheet `master` branch.

Do you need to migrate? There is [an automated tool](/docs/topics/migration-from-PHPExcel.md) for that.
