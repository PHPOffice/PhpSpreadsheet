The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com)
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org).

## Unreleased - TBD

### Added

- Implementation of the Excel `AVERAGEIFS()` functions as part of a restructuring of Database functions and Conditional Statistical functions.
- Support for date values and percentages in query parameters for Database functions, and the IF expressions in functions like COUNTIF() and AVERAGEIF(). [#1875](https://github.com/PHPOffice/PhpSpreadsheet/pull/1875)
- Support for booleans, and for wildcard text search in query parameters for Database functions, and the IF expressions in functions like COUNTIF() and AVERAGEIF(). [#1876](https://github.com/PHPOffice/PhpSpreadsheet/pull/1876)
- Implemented DataBar for conditional formatting in Xlsx, providing read/write and creation of (type, value, direction, fills, border, axis position, color settings) as DataBar options in Excel. [#1754](https://github.com/PHPOffice/PhpSpreadsheet/pull/1754)
- Alignment for ODS Writer [#1796](https://github.com/PHPOffice/PhpSpreadsheet/issues/1796)
- Basic implementation of the PERMUTATIONA() Statistical Function

### Changed

- Formula functions that previously called PHP functions directly are now processed through the Excel Functions classes; resolving issues with PHP8 stricter typing. [#1789](https://github.com/PHPOffice/PhpSpreadsheet/issues/1789)

  The following MathTrig functions are affected:
  `ABS()`, `ACOS()`, `ACOSH()`, `ASIN()`, `ASINH()`, `ATAN()`, `ATANH()`,
  `COS()`, `COSH()`, `DEGREES()` (rad2deg), `EXP()`, `LN()` (log), `LOG10()`,
  `RADIANS()` (deg2rad), `SIN()`, `SINH()`, `SQRT()`, `TAN()`, `TANH()`.
  
  One TextData function is also affected: `REPT()` (str_repeat).
- `formatAsDate` correctly matches language metadata, reverting c55272e
- Formulae that previously crashed on sub function call returning excel error value now return said value.
  The following functions are affected `CUMPRINC()`, `CUMIPMT()`, `AMORLINC()`,
  `AMORDEGRC()`.
- Adapt some function error return value to match excel's error.
  The following functions are affected `PPMT()`, `IPMT()`.

### Deprecated

- Calling many of the Excel formula functions directly rather than through the Calculation Engine.

  The logic for these Functions is now being moved out of the categorised `Database`, `DateTime`, `Engineering`, `Financial`, `Logical`, `LookupRef`, `MathTrig`, `Statistical`, `TextData` and `Web` classes into small, dedicated classes for individual functions or related groups of functions.

  This makes the logic in these classes easier to maintain; and will reduce the memory footprint required to execute formulae when calling these functions.

### Removed

- Nothing.

### Fixed
- Avoid Duplicate Titles When Reading Multiple HTML Files.[Issue #1823](https://github.com/PHPOffice/PhpSpreadsheet/issues/1823) [PR #1829](https://github.com/PHPOffice/PhpSpreadsheet/pull/1829)
- Fixed issue with Worksheet's `getCell()` method when trying to get a cell by defined name. [#1858](https://github.com/PHPOffice/PhpSpreadsheet/issues/1858)
- Fix possible endless loop in NumberFormat Masks [#1792](https://github.com/PHPOffice/PhpSpreadsheet/issues/1792)
- Fix problem resulting from  literal dot inside quotes in number format masks. [PR #1830](https://github.com/PHPOffice/PhpSpreadsheet/pull/1830)
- Resolve Google Sheets Xlsx charts issue. Google Sheets uses oneCellAnchor positioning and does not include *Cache values in the exported Xlsx. [PR #1761](https://github.com/PHPOffice/PhpSpreadsheet/pull/1761)
- Fix for Xlsx Chart axis titles mapping to correct X or Y axis label when only one is present. [PR #1760](https://github.com/PHPOffice/PhpSpreadsheet/pull/1760)
- Fix For Null Exception on ODS Read of Page Settings. [#1772](https://github.com/PHPOffice/PhpSpreadsheet/issues/1772)
- Fix Xlsx reader overriding manually set number format with builtin number format. [PR #1805](https://github.com/PHPOffice/PhpSpreadsheet/pull/1805)
- Fix Xlsx reader cell alignment. [PR #1710](https://github.com/PHPOffice/PhpSpreadsheet/pull/1710)
- Fix for not yet implemented data-types in Open Document writer [Issue #1674](https://github.com/PHPOffice/PhpSpreadsheet/issues/1674)
- Fix XLSX reader when having a corrupt numeric cell data type [PR #1664](https://github.com/phpoffice/phpspreadsheet/pull/1664)
- Fix on `CUMPRINC()`, `CUMIPMT()`, `AMORLINC()`, `AMORDEGRC()` usage. When those functions called one of `YEARFRAC()`, `PPMT()`, `IPMT()` and they would get back an error value (represented as a string), trying to use numeral operands (`+`, `/`, `-`, `*`) on said return value and a number (`float or `int`) would fail.

## 1.15.0 - 2020-10-11

### Added

- Implemented Page Order for Xlsx and Xls Readers, and provided Page Settings (Orientation, Scale, Horizontal/Vertical Centering, Page Order, Margins) support for Ods, Gnumeric and Xls Readers [#1559](https://github.com/PHPOffice/PhpSpreadsheet/pull/1559)
- Implementation of the Excel `LOGNORM.DIST()`, `NORM.S.DIST()`, `GAMMA()` and `GAUSS()` functions. [#1588](https://github.com/PHPOffice/PhpSpreadsheet/pull/1588)
- Named formula implementation, and improved handling of Defined Names generally [#1535](https://github.com/PHPOffice/PhpSpreadsheet/pull/1535)
  - Defined Names are now case-insensitive

  - Correct evaluation of named range operators in calculations
  - fix resolution of relative named range values in the calculation engine; previously all named range values had been treated as absolute.

  - Support for nested ranges and formulae (named ranges and formulae that reference other named ranges/formulae) in calculations
  - Introduction of a helper to convert address formats between R1C1 and A1 (and the reverse)
  - Proper support for both named ranges and named formulae in all appropriate Readers
    - **Xlsx** (Previously only simple named ranges were supported)
    - **Xls** (Previously only simple named ranges were supported)
    - **Gnumeric** (Previously neither named ranges nor formulae were supported)
    - **Ods** (Previously neither named ranges nor formulae were supported)

### Changed

- Improve Coverage for ODS Reader [#1545](https://github.com/phpoffice/phpspreadsheet/pull/1545)
- Named formula implementation, and improved handling of Defined Names generally [#1535](https://github.com/PHPOffice/PhpSpreadsheet/pull/1535)
- fix resolution of relative named range values in the calculation engine; previously all named range values had been treated as absolute.

- Improving Coverage for Excel2003 XML Reader [#1557](https://github.com/phpoffice/phpspreadsheet/pull/1557)

### Deprecated

- **IMPORTANT NOTE:** This Introduces a **BC break** in the handling of named ranges. Previously, a named range cell reference of `B2` would be treated identically to a named range cell reference of `$B2` or `B$2` or `$B$2` because the calculation engine treated then all as absolute references. These changes "fix" that, so the calculation engine now handles relative references in named ranges correctly.
  This change that resolves previously incorrect behaviour in the calculation may affect users who have dynamically defined named ranges using relative references when they should have used absolute references.

## 1.8.0 - 2019-07-01

### Security Fix (CVE-2019-12331)

- Detect double-encoded xml in the Security scanner, and reject as suspicious.
- This change also broadens the scope of the `libxml_disable_entity_loader` setting when reading XML-based formats, so that it is enabled while the xml is being parsed and not simply while it is loaded.
  On some versions of PHP, this can cause problems because it is not thread-safe, and can affect other PHP scripts running on the same server. This flag is set to true when instantiating a loader, and back to its original setting when the Reader is no longer in scope, or manually unset.
- Provide a check to identify whether libxml_disable_entity_loader is thread-safe or not.

  `XmlScanner::threadSafeLibxmlDisableEntityLoaderAvailability()`
- Provide an option to disable the libxml_disable_entity_loader call through settings. This is not recommended as it reduces the security of the XML-based readers, and should only be used if you understand the consequences and have no other choice.

### Added

- Added support for the SWITCH function [#963](https://github.com/PHPOffice/PhpSpreadsheet/issues/963) and [#983](https://github.com/PHPOffice/PhpSpreadsheet/pull/983)
