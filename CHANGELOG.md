## 1.23.0 - 2022-04-24

### Added

- Ods Writer support for Freeze Pane [Issue #2013](https://github.com/PHPOffice/PhpSpreadsheet/issues/2013) [PR #2755](https://github.com/PHPOffice/PhpSpreadsheet/pull/2755)
- Ods Writer support for setting column width/row height (including the use of AutoSize) [Issue #2346](https://github.com/PHPOffice/PhpSpreadsheet/issues/2346) [PR #2753](https://github.com/PHPOffice/PhpSpreadsheet/pull/2753)
- Introduced CellAddress, CellRange, RowRange and ColumnRange value objects that can be used as an alternative to a string value (e.g. `'C5'`, `'B2:D4'`, `'2:2'` or `'B:C'`) in appropriate contexts.
- Implementation of the FILTER(), SORT(), SORTBY() and UNIQUE() Lookup/Reference (array) functions.
- Implementation of the ISREF() Information function.
- Added support for reading "formatted" numeric values from Csv files; although default behaviour of reading these values as strings is preserved.

  (i.e a value of "12,345.67" can be read as numeric `12345.67`, not simply as a string `"12,345.67"`, if the `castFormattedNumberToNumeric()` setting is enabled.

  This functionality is locale-aware, using the server's locale settings to identify the thousands and decimal separators.

- Support for two cell anchor drawing of images. [#2532](https://github.com/PHPOffice/PhpSpreadsheet/pull/2532) [#2674](https://github.com/PHPOffice/PhpSpreadsheet/pull/2674)
- Limited support for Xls Reader to handle Conditional Formatting:

  Ranges and Rules are read, but style is currently limited to font size, weight and color; and to fill style and color.

- Add ability to suppress Mac line ending check for CSV [#2623](https://github.com/PHPOffice/PhpSpreadsheet/pull/2623)
- Initial support for creating and writing Tables (Xlsx Writer only) [PR #2671](https://github.com/PHPOffice/PhpSpreadsheet/pull/2671)

  See `/samples/Table` for examples of use.

  Note that PreCalculateFormulas needs to be disabled when saving spreadsheets containing tables with formulae (totals or column formulae).

### Changed

- Gnumeric Reader now loads number formatting for cells.
- Gnumeric Reader now correctly identifies selected worksheet and selected cells in a worksheet.
- Some Refactoring of the Ods Reader, moving all formula and address translation from Ods to Excel into a separate class to eliminate code duplication and ensure consistency.
- Make Boolean Conversion in Csv Reader locale-aware when using the String Value Binder.

  This is determined by the Calculation Engine locale setting.

  (i.e. `"Vrai"` wil be converted to a boolean `true` if the Locale is set to `fr`.)
- Allow `psr/simple-cache` 2.x

### Deprecated

- All Excel Function implementations in `Calculation\Functions` (including the Error functions) have been moved to dedicated classes for groups of related functions. See the docblocks against all the deprecated methods for details of the new methods to call instead. At some point, these old classes will be deleted.
- Worksheet methods that reference cells "byColumnandRow". All such methods have an equivalent that references the cell by its address (e.g. '`E3'` rather than `5, 3`).

  These functions now accept either a cell address string (`'E3')` or an array with columnId and rowId (`[5, 3]`) or a new `CellAddress` object as their `cellAddress`/`coordinate` argument.
  This includes the methods:
  - `setCellValueByColumnAndRow()` use the equivalent `setCellValue()`
  - `setCellValueExplicitByColumnAndRow()` use the equivalent `setCellValueExplicit()`
  - `getCellByColumnAndRow()` use the equivalent `getCell()`
  - `cellExistsByColumnAndRow()` use the equivalent `cellExists()`
  - `getStyleByColumnAndRow()` use the equivalent `getStyle()`
  - `setBreakByColumnAndRow()` use the equivalent `setBreak()`
  - `mergeCellsByColumnAndRow()` use the equivalent `mergeCells()`
  - `unmergeCellsByColumnAndRow()` use the equivalent `unmergeCells()`
  - `protectCellsByColumnAndRow()` use the equivalent `protectCells()`
  - `unprotectCellsByColumnAndRow()` use the equivalent `unprotectCells()`
  - `setAutoFilterByColumnAndRow()` use the equivalent `setAutoFilter()`
  - `freezePaneByColumnAndRow()` use the equivalent `freezePane()`
  - `getCommentByColumnAndRow()` use the equivalent `getComment()`
  - `setSelectedCellByColumnAndRow()` use the equivalent `setSelectedCells()`

  This change provides more consistency in the methods (not every "by cell address" method has an equivalent "byColumnAndRow" method);
  and the "by cell address" methods often provide more flexibility, such as allowing a range of cells, or referencing them by passing the defined name of a named range as the argument.

### Removed

- Nothing

### Fixed

- Make allowance for the AutoFilter dropdown icon in the first row of an Autofilter range when using Autosize columns. [Issue #2413](https://github.com/PHPOffice/PhpSpreadsheet/issues/2413) [PR #2754](https://github.com/PHPOffice/PhpSpreadsheet/pull/2754)
- Support for "chained" ranges (e.g. `A5:C10:C20:F1`) in the Calculation Engine; and also support for using named ranges with the Range operator (e.g. `NamedRange1:NamedRange2`) [Issue #2730](https://github.com/PHPOffice/PhpSpreadsheet/issues/2730) [PR #2746](https://github.com/PHPOffice/PhpSpreadsheet/pull/2746)
- Update Conditional Formatting ranges and rule conditions when inserting/deleting rows/columns [Issue #2678](https://github.com/PHPOffice/PhpSpreadsheet/issues/2678) [PR #2689](https://github.com/PHPOffice/PhpSpreadsheet/pull/2689)
- Allow `INDIRECT()` to accept row/column ranges as well as cell ranges [PR #2687](https://github.com/PHPOffice/PhpSpreadsheet/pull/2687)
- Fix bug when deleting cells with hyperlinks, where the hyperlink was then being "inherited" by whatever cell moved to that cell address.
- Fix bug in Conditional Formatting in the Xls Writer that resulted in a broken file when there were multiple conditional ranges in a worksheet.
- Fix Conditional Formatting in the Xls Writer to work with rules that contain string literals, cell references and formulae.
- Fix for setting Active Sheet to the first loaded worksheet when bookViews element isn't defined [Issue #2666](https://github.com/PHPOffice/PhpSpreadsheet/issues/2666) [PR #2669](https://github.com/PHPOffice/PhpSpreadsheet/pull/2669)
- Fixed behaviour of XLSX font style vertical align settings [PR #2619](https://github.com/PHPOffice/PhpSpreadsheet/pull/2619)
- Resolved formula translations to handle separators (row and column) for array functions as well as for function argument separators; and cleanly handle nesting levels.

  Note that this method is used when translating Excel functions between `en_us` and other locale languages, as well as when converting formulae between different spreadsheet formats (e.g. Ods to Excel).

  Nor is this a perfect solution, as there may still be issues when function calls have array arguments that themselves contain function calls; but it's still better than the current logic.
- Fix for escaping double quotes within a formula [Issue #1971](https://github.com/PHPOffice/PhpSpreadsheet/issues/1971) [PR #2651](https://github.com/PHPOffice/PhpSpreadsheet/pull/2651)

- Use color palette if supplied [Issue #2499](https://github.com/PHPOffice/PhpSpreadsheet/issues/2499) [PR #2595](https://github.com/PHPOffice/PhpSpreadsheet/pull/2595)
- Xls reader treat drawing offsets as int rather than float [PR #2648](https://github.com/PHPOffice/PhpSpreadsheet/pull/2648)
- Handle booleans in conditional styles properly [PR #2654](https://github.com/PHPOffice/PhpSpreadsheet/pull/2654)
- Fix for reading files in the root directory of a ZipFile, which should not be prefixed by relative paths ("./") as dirname($filename) does by default.
- Fix invalid style of cells in empty columns with columnDimensions and rows with rowDimensions in added external sheet. [PR #2739](https://github.com/PHPOffice/PhpSpreadsheet/pull/2739)
- Time Interval Formatting [Issue #2768](https://github.com/PHPOffice/PhpSpreadsheet/issues/2768) [PR #2772](https://github.com/PHPOffice/PhpSpreadsheet/pull/2772)

    - Blanks/NoBlanks
    - Errors/NoErrors
    - Duplicates/Unique
    - Expression
  - Provision of CF Wizards (for all the above listed rule types) to help create/modify CF Rules without having to manage all the combinations of types/operators, and the complexities of formula expressions, or the text/timePeriod attributes.

    See [documentation](https://phpspreadsheet.readthedocs.io/en/latest/topics/conditional-formatting/) for details

  - Full support of the above CF Rules for the Xlsx Reader and Writer; even when the file being loaded has CF rules listed in the `<extLst><ext><ConditionalFormattings>` element for the worksheet rather than the `<ConditionalFormatting>` element.

### Added

- Implementation of the Excel `AVERAGEIFS()` functions as part of a restructuring of Database functions and Conditional Statistical functions.

- Alignment for ODS Writer [#1796](https://github.com/PHPOffice/PhpSpreadsheet/issues/1796)
- Basic implementation of the PERMUTATIONA() Statistical Function

### Changed

- Formula functions that previously called PHP functions directly are now processed through the Excel Functions classes; resolving issues with PHP8 stricter typing. [#1789](https://github.com/PHPOffice/PhpSpreadsheet/issues/1789)

  The following MathTrig functions are affected:
  `ABS()`, `ACOS()`, `ACOSH()`, `ASIN()`, `ASINH()`, `ATAN()`, `ATANH()`,
  `COS()`, `COSH()`, `DEGREES()` (rad2deg), `EXP()`, `LN()` (log), `LOG10()`,
  `RADIANS()` (deg2rad), `SIN()`, `SINH()`, `SQRT()`, `TAN()`, `TANH()`.

  One TextData function is also affected: `REPT()` (str_repeat).
- `formatAsDate` correctly matches language metadata, reverting c55272e
- Formulae that previously crashed on sub function call returning excel error value now return said value.
  The following functions are affected `CUMPRINC()`, `CUMIPMT()`, `AMORLINC()`,
  `AMORDEGRC()`.
- Adapt some function error return value to match excel's error.
  The following functions are affected `PPMT()`, `IPMT()`.

### Deprecated

- Calling many of the Excel formula functions directly rather than through the Calculation Engine.

  The logic for these Functions is now being moved out of the categorised `Database`, `DateTime`, `Engineering`, `Financial`, `Logical`, `LookupRef`, `MathTrig`, `Statistical`, `TextData` and `Web` classes into small, dedicated classes for individual functions or related groups of functions.

  This makes the logic in these classes easier to maintain; and will reduce the memory footprint required to execute formulae when calling these functions.

### Removed

- Nothing.

### Fixed

- Avoid Duplicate Titles When Reading Multiple HTML Files.[Issue #1823](https://github.com/PHPOffice/PhpSpreadsheet/issues/1823) [PR #1829](https://github.com/PHPOffice/PhpSpreadsheet/pull/1829)

- Fix XLSX reader when having a corrupt numeric cell data type [PR #1664](https://github.com/phpoffice/phpspreadsheet/pull/1664)
- Fix on `CUMPRINC()`, `CUMIPMT()`, `AMORLINC()`, `AMORDEGRC()` usage. When those functions called one of `YEARFRAC()`, `PPMT()`, `IPMT()` and they would get back an error value (represented as a string), trying to use numeral operands (`+`, `/`, `-`, `*`) on said return value and a number (`float or `int`) would fail.

    - **Xls** (Previously neither named ranges nor formulae were supported) - Still not supported, but some parser issues resolved that previously failed to differentiate between a defined name and a function name
    - **Ods** (Previously neither named ranges nor formulae were supported)
- Support for PHP 8.0

### Changed

- Improve Coverage for ODS Reader [#1545](https://github.com/phpoffice/phpspreadsheet/pull/1545)
- Named formula implementation, and improved handling of Defined Names generally [#1535](https://github.com/PHPOffice/PhpSpreadsheet/pull/1535)
- fix resolution of relative named range values in the calculation engine; previously all named range values had been treated as absolute.
- Drop $this->spreadSheet null check from Xlsx Writer [#1646](https://github.com/phpoffice/phpspreadsheet/pull/1646)
- Improving Coverage for Excel2003 XML Reader [#1557](https://github.com/phpoffice/phpspreadsheet/pull/1557)

### Deprecated

- **IMPORTANT NOTE:** This Introduces a **BC break** in the handling of named ranges. Previously, a named range cell reference of `B2` would be treated identically to a named range cell reference of `$B2` or `B$2` or `$B$2` because the calculation engine treated then all as absolute references. These changes "fix" that, so the calculation engine now handles relative references in named ranges correctly.
  This change that resolves previously incorrect behaviour in the calculation may affect users who have dynamically defined named ranges using relative references when they should have used absolute references.

## 1.8.0 - 2019-07-01

### Security Fix (CVE-2019-12331)

- Detect double-encoded xml in the Security scanner, and reject as suspicious.
- This change also broadens the scope of the `libxml_disable_entity_loader` setting when reading XML-based formats, so that it is enabled while the xml is being parsed and not simply while it is loaded.
  On some versions of PHP, this can cause problems because it is not thread-safe, and can affect other PHP scripts running on the same server. This flag is set to true when instantiating a loader, and back to its original setting when the Reader is no longer in scope, or manually unset.
- Provide a check to identify whether libxml_disable_entity_loader is thread-safe or not.

  `XmlScanner::threadSafeLibxmlDisableEntityLoaderAvailability()`
- Provide an option to disable the libxml_disable_entity_loader call through settings. This is not recommended as it reduces the security of the XML-based readers, and should only be used if you understand the consequences and have no other choice.

### Added

- Added support for the SWITCH function [#963](https://github.com/PHPOffice/PhpSpreadsheet/issues/963) and [#983](https://github.com/PHPOffice/PhpSpreadsheet/pull/983)
